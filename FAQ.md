## **Ordering**

### How do I order?
Fill out our contact form or email us with information about what you are looking for including when your event is, how many people you are serving, any themes and colors as well as links to any inspirational photos.

### What size cake should I get?

### How far in advanced should I book?
Reservations should be made at least two weeks before your event.

### Can I make changes to my order?
Yes. We can accept changes up to a week before the scheduled delivery/pickup date, but changes may incur extra charges.

### Do you do tasting and consultation sessions?
Yes. Tastings are $25 for a 45-minute session and include a variety of cake flavors to sample. Sessions are limited to two people. If an order is placed after a session, the $25 will be applied as a credit toward your order. Let us know a week in advanced if you need to cancel or reschedule otherwise fee is non-refundable.

During the session, we will discuss design, so bring any inspirational pictures or invitations for the design you envision.

### Will my cake look exactly like a picture I send you?
Our creations are our own designs and we do not replicate other's artwork. We will try to incorporate elements of other designs to keep a particular style or theme, but we do not copy. Provided photos are inspiration only.


## **Pricing**

### How are your services priced?
We price our products by the serving. Cakes and cupcakes start out at $3 per serving while cookies begin at $3.50 each. Check out our **[cake serving guide](/cake-guide)** to get an idea of what sizes you'll need.

### How are payments handled?
After orders are finalized, we will send a PayPal invoice via email. PayPal accepts checks, credit and debit card payments. Orders of $90 or less are to be paid in full at the time of booking. Orders of more than $90 require half of the total price to be paid as a deposit at the time of booking. Remaining balance is due one week prior to scheduled pickup/delivery date. However for order of $500 or more, remaining balance is due 4 weeks before scheduled pickup/delivery date.
